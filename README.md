# Introduction
Originally this script will convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”. The scope of this repo has been increased from just calculating one animal age to multiple. It will still remain as a console app until it has accamulated a numbers of animals, then the process of building the interface will begin.

## Example of one animal (Dog)
**Explanation**
Because dogs mature at a faster rate than us human. And this happen because time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. So, this app will help you find out how old would you be if you were a dog.

**Math!**
* The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
* Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
